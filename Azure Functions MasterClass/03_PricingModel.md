Azure Functions offer several **pricing models** depending on how you want to host, scale, and pay for your workloads. Here's a breakdown of the main **Azure Functions pricing plans**, including **Consumption**, **Premium**, **Elastic Premium**, **Dedicated (App Service Plan)**, and **Flex Consumption**.

## üí∞ **Azure Functions Pricing Plans Comparison**

| Plan                             | Description                                                                                                               | Use Case                                                                             | Billing Basis                            | Cold Start            |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| **Consumption Plan**             | Default serverless model. Automatically scales and you pay per execution.                                                 | Event-driven apps with sporadic usage.                                               | Per execution, GB-s, and execution time  | ‚úÖ Yes                 |
| **Premium Plan**                 | Like Consumption, but with VMs always warm, no cold starts, and more power.                                               | High-performance or enterprise apps that need consistent response time.              | Per second of CPU/memory + executions    | ‚ùå No                  |
| **Elastic Premium Plan**         | Premium but adds scaling flexibility similar to Elastic App Services.                                                     | Advanced autoscaling with control over instance limits and warm-up.                  | Like Premium Plan                        | ‚ùå No                  |
| **Dedicated (App Service Plan)** | Run functions on dedicated VMs (App Service Plan). Useful when combining with web apps.                                   | Apps that need full control over compute or use long-running jobs.                   | Per App Service VM pricing               | ‚ùå No                  |
| **Flex Consumption (New)**       | Hybrid between Consumption and Premium: better cold start performance with flexible scaling, and lower cost than Premium. | Mid-range workloads needing more control and performance without full Premium costs. | Pay-per-execution + instance reservation | ‚õîÔ∏è Reduced cold start |

## üîç **Detailed Breakdown**

### üîπ **1. Consumption Plan**

* **Pricing**: First 1M executions & 400,000 GB-s/month free. Then charged per execution and resource usage.
* **Cold Start**: Yes (may delay first request after idle).
* **Max Timeout**: 5 minutes (can be increased to 60 mins via config).
* **Scaling**: Auto-scales on demand.
* **Use When**: You want the lowest cost for occasional workloads.

### üîπ **2. Premium Plan**

* **Pricing**: Based on reserved instances + per execution.
* **Cold Start**: No.
* **Max Timeout**: Unlimited.
* **Scaling**: Auto-scales with pre-warmed instances.
* **Use When**: You need high performance, no cold starts, VNET support, or larger memory (up to 14 GB).

### üîπ **3. Elastic Premium Plan**

* **Same as Premium**, but tailored to dynamic scaling like Web Apps.
* Good for applications with fluctuating load patterns.

### üîπ **4. App Service Plan (Dedicated)**

* **Pricing**: Pay for the VM size and number (regardless of usage).
* **Cold Start**: No.
* **Max Timeout**: Unlimited.
* **Scaling**: Manual or rule-based scaling.
* **Use When**: You already have existing App Service workloads or want full compute control.

### üîπ **5. Flex Consumption (Preview/GA in some regions)**

* **Hybrid Plan**: Designed to bridge the gap between Consumption and Premium.
* **Pricing**: Lower than Premium but with improved responsiveness.
* **Scaling**: Automatic with fine control over concurrency and warm instances.
* **Use When**: You need better performance than Consumption but don‚Äôt want full Premium cost.
