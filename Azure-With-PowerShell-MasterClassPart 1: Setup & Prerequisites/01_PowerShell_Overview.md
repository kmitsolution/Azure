Introduction to **PowerShell**, followed by key benefits of using it with **Azure**:

## 🧭 **PowerShell Overview**

**PowerShell** is a cross-platform automation and configuration tool/framework developed by Microsoft. It consists of a command-line shell and a scripting language built on .NET. Originally designed for system administration, it has grown into a powerful tool for managing everything from Windows servers to cloud environments like Microsoft Azure.

* PowerShell supports **task automation**, **configuration management**, and **remote system administration**.
* It can manage **local and remote computers**, **cloud services**, **filesystems**, and even **APIs**.
* PowerShell is **object-based**, meaning it works with .NET objects instead of plain text — which makes scripting more powerful and reliable.
