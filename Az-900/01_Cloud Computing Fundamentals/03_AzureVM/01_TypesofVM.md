## Spot instances
Spot Instances in Azure are a cost-effective option for running workloads that are flexible in terms of when and how they execute. They allow you to take advantage of unused Azure capacity at a significantly reduced cost compared to standard on-demand VMs. Here’s a detailed overview:

### **What Are Azure Spot Instances?**

- **Definition**: Azure Spot Instances are a pricing option for Azure Virtual Machines that lets you bid on unused Azure compute capacity. They offer substantial discounts over standard pricing, but come with the caveat that Azure can reclaim the instances with very short notice if the capacity is needed for other purposes.

- **Cost**: Spot Instances can be up to 90% cheaper than standard pay-as-you-go VM prices. This significant discount is a major advantage if your application can tolerate interruptions.

- **Availability**: Since Spot Instances use spare capacity, their availability can vary based on demand. Azure may not always have enough capacity available for Spot Instances, and the VMs can be evicted at any time if Azure needs to allocate the capacity to other customers.

### **Key Features of Spot Instances**

1. **Cost Savings**:
   - **Price**: Typically much lower than standard pricing, making them ideal for cost-sensitive applications.
   - **Bidding**: You don’t bid directly for the instances but rather accept the current pricing model, which can fluctuate based on demand.

2. **Interruptions**:
   - **Eviction**: Spot Instances can be evicted with little notice if Azure needs the capacity. You are notified via a preemption notification, which provides a short window to save your work and shut down the VM gracefully.
   - **Grace Period**: Usually, you get a 30-second warning before the VM is evicted, allowing you to perform some last-minute tasks.

3. **Flexibility**:
   - **Use Cases**: Ideal for non-critical or stateless workloads where interruptions are acceptable, such as batch processing, development and test environments, and large-scale data analytics.
   - **Integration**: You can use Spot Instances with Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets to automatically handle the scaling and manage the interruptions.

### **How to Use Azure Spot Instances**

1. **Creating a Spot Instance**:
   - **Via Azure Portal**:
     1. Go to the Azure portal.
     2. Navigate to "Virtual Machines" and click "Add" to create a new VM.
     3. On the "Basics" tab, select your desired options and proceed to the "Size" tab.
     4. Select the "Spot" option to use Spot pricing.
     5. Configure other settings as needed and create the VM.

   - **Via Azure CLI**:
     ```sh
     az vm create \
       --resource-group myResourceGroup \
       --name mySpotVM \
       --image UbuntuLTS \
       --size Standard_D2s_v3 \
       --priority Spot \
       --max-price -1 \
       --output table
     ```
     In this command, `--priority Spot` indicates that the VM should be a Spot instance, and `--max-price -1` sets the maximum price to the current market rate.

2. **Handling Interruptions**:
   - **Preemption Notification**: Implement logic in your application to handle the preemption notification, which is sent 30 seconds before the VM is evicted.
   - **Save State**: Regularly save your work and state to persistent storage (e.g., Azure Blob Storage) to minimize the impact of interruptions.

3. **Scaling and Management**:
   - **Scale Sets**: Use Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets to manage and scale Spot Instances. Scale Sets can automatically handle the deployment and management of Spot VMs, including scaling in and out based on demand.

### **Azure Documentation**

For more detailed information and guidance on using Spot Instances, you can refer to the official Azure documentation:
- **[Azure Spot Virtual Machines Overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/spot-vms)**
- **[How to use Azure Spot Virtual Machines](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/spot-vms-best-practices)**

Spot Instances are a powerful tool for reducing costs and handling variable workloads, but they are best suited for scenarios where occasional interruptions can be tolerated.
