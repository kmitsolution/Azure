# Types of Disks in Azure

In Azure, there are several types of disks available, each designed to meet different performance, durability, and cost requirements. Hereâ€™s an overview of the main types:

### **1. Standard HDD (Hard Disk Drive)**
- **Description**: Designed for workloads where performance is less critical and cost is a primary concern. These disks offer lower performance and are typically used for infrequent access or backup scenarios.
- **Performance**: Lower IOPS (Input/Output Operations Per Second) and throughput compared to other disk types.
- **Use Case**: Development and testing environments, infrequent access data, and low-cost storage.

### **2. Standard SSD (Solid State Drive)**
- **Description**: Provides better performance than Standard HDDs at a moderate cost. Suitable for applications with higher performance requirements than Standard HDDs but where premium performance is not necessary.
- **Performance**: Higher IOPS and throughput compared to Standard HDDs but not as high as Premium SSDs or Ultra disks.
- **Use Case**: Web servers, lightly loaded databases, and production applications where performance is important but cost is also a consideration.

### **3. Premium SSD**
- **Description**: High-performance SSD disks designed for demanding applications that require consistent and low latency performance. These disks are backed by solid-state drives and offer higher IOPS and throughput.
- **Performance**: High IOPS, low latency, and consistent performance.
- **Use Case**: High-performance databases, production workloads, and enterprise applications requiring high IOPS and low latency.

### **4. Ultra Disk**
- **Description**: Offers the highest performance and lowest latency available in Azure, designed for very demanding applications. Ultra disks provide high IOPS and throughput, and can be dynamically adjusted for performance and capacity.
- **Performance**: Extremely high IOPS, low latency, and configurable throughput.
- **Use Case**: Large transactional databases, data analytics, and applications with extremely high performance requirements.

### **5. Managed Disks**
- **Description**: A higher-level abstraction over the traditional disk types (Standard HDD, Standard SSD, Premium SSD). Azure manages the storage account and the underlying infrastructure, providing simplified management and increased reliability.
- **Performance**: Varies based on the type of managed disk (Standard HDD, Standard SSD, Premium SSD, Ultra Disk).
- **Use Case**: Suitable for any application or service requiring Azure storage, offering simplicity and reliability.

### **6. Azure Blob Storage (for VHDs)**
- **Description**: While not a disk type per se, Azure Blob Storage can be used to store VHDs (Virtual Hard Disks) for virtual machines. This is useful for creating custom disks or managing large amounts of unstructured data.
- **Performance**: Depends on the type of Blob Storage used (Hot, Cool, Archive).
- **Use Case**: Backup storage, custom VM images, and large-scale data storage.

### **7. Azure Disk Encryption**
- **Description**: While not a type of disk, Azure Disk Encryption uses either platform-managed keys or customer-managed keys to protect the data on the disks. It can be applied to Standard HDD, Standard SSD, Premium SSD, and Ultra Disks.
- **Performance**: No significant impact on performance; ensures data security.

Each of these disk types caters to different needs, so you can choose the one that best fits your performance, cost, and durability requirements.
