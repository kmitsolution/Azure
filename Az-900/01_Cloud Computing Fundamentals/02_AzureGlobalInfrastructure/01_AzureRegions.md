## 🔷 What Are Azure Regions?

An **Azure Region** is a set of **datacenters deployed within a specific geographic location**. Each region provides high availability, fault tolerance, and disaster recovery capabilities.

For example:
- **East US** region has multiple datacenters in Virginia.
- **West Europe** region typically refers to facilities in the Netherlands.

## 🌍 Azure Geographies

**Azure Geography** is a defined area that typically contains **two or more regions**. Each geography ensures data residency, compliance, and resiliency boundaries.

### Example Geographies:
| Geography       | Regions Included                                      |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| **United States**  | East US, West US, Central US, etc.                   |
| **Europe**         | North Europe, West Europe, etc.                      |
| **Asia Pacific**   | Southeast Asia, East Asia, Japan East, etc.         |

**Key Points**:
- Bound by country or regional borders (like EU).
- Supports data residency and sovereignty.
- Used to meet regulatory compliance (e.g., GDPR in the EU).

## 🏛️ Special Regions (China, US Gov, etc.)

### 🔹 China Regions
- Operated by **21Vianet**, a local provider.
- **Isolated from the global Azure network** due to Chinese regulations.
- Examples: **China North**, **China East**

### 🔹 US Government Regions
- Dedicated to **US federal, state, and local government** entities.
- Examples: **US Gov Virginia**, **US Gov Arizona**
- Isolated from the public Azure cloud, with extra compliance (FedRAMP, etc.)

### 🔹 Other Special Cloud Regions
- **Azure Germany**: Data sovereignty for Germany (now merged into standard Azure).

## 🔁 Region Pairs

### What is a Region Pair?
Azure **pairs regions within the same geography** for disaster recovery. Each pair is:
- Physically separated (hundreds of miles apart).
- **Mutually replicated** (especially for services like storage).
- Scheduled for **maintenance at different times**.
<a href=https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/reliability/regions-list> Region Pair List </a>
### Example Pairs:
| Primary Region | Paired Region |
|----------------|---------------|
| East US        | West US       |
| North Europe   | West Europe   |
| Southeast Asia | East Asia     |

**Why It Matters**:
- High availability.
- Geo-redundant storage (GRS) uses the paired region.
- In disaster recovery planning, region pairs are ideal.

## 📍 What is "Location" in Resource Creation?

When you create a resource in Azure, you must select a **Location**, which refers to the **Azure Region**.

### Why is this important?
- Determines **where your data and compute resources are hosted**.
- Impacts **latency**, **compliance**, **cost**, and **available services**.
- Some resources (like Azure Storage) are region-specific.
- Some global resources (like Azure AD) are not tied to a region.

## 🌐 Azure Speed Test – How to Choose a Region?
Website: [https://azurespeedtest.azurewebsites.net](https://azurespeedtest.azurewebsites.net)

This tool:
- **Tests network latency** between your device and Azure regions.
- Helps you select the region **closest and fastest to your users**.

### Recommendation:
- Choose a region with **low latency** and **high availability** of the needed services.
- Balance speed, cost, compliance, and disaster recovery.

## 📦 Product Availability by Region

Use this Microsoft page:  
👉 [https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/explore/global-infrastructure/products-by-region/table](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/explore/global-infrastructure/products-by-region/table)

### You Can:
- Filter by **region** (e.g., West Europe).
- See which services (VMs, AI, Database, etc.) are **available, preview, or not supported**.
